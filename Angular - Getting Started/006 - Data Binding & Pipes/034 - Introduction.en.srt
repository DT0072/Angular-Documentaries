There's more to data binding than just

1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,049
displaying component properties. Welcome

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,460
back to Angular: Getting Started from

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,599
Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata,

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,720
and in this module, we explore more data

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,550
binding features and transform bound data

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,350
with pipes. To provide a great interactive

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,910
user experience, we want to bind DOM

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,399
elements to component properties, so the

9
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,640
component can change the look and feel as

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,049
needed. We can use bindings to change

11
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,399
element colors or styles based on data

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,450
values, update font size based on user

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,219
preferences or a sudden image source from

14
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:43,399
a database field. And we want notification

15
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,689
of user actions and other events from the

16
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:48,149
DOM, so the component can respond

17
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,420
accordingly. For example, we respond to a

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,740
click on a button to hide or show images.

19
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,950
And sometimes we want the best of both

20
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,399
worlds using two‑way binding to set an

21
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,000
element property and receive event

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,730
notifications of user changes to that

23
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,879
property. In this module, we'll use

24
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,510
Angular's property binding to set HTML

25
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,290
element properties in the DOM. We walk

26
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,650
through how to handle user events, such as

27
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,870
a button click, with event binding and how

28
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,540
to handle user input with two‑way binding.

29
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,909
Lastly, we'll discover how to transform

30
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:29,620
bound data with pipes. And here, once

31
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,819
again, is our application architecture. We

32
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,030
have the first cut of our

33
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,959
ProductListComponent, but it doesn't have

34
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,980
any interactivity. In this module, we'll

35
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,939
use data binding features to add

36
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:49,000
interactivity to the ProductListComponent. Let's get started.
