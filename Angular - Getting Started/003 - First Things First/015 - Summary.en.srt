0
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,469
In this module, we introduced TypeScript.

1
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:06,240
TypeScript has all the productivity

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,689
features of newer versions of JavaScript,

3
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:11,539
plus strong typing for better tooling.

4
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,970
Next, we installed what we needed. We

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,550
installed VS Code as our code editor, and

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,460
installed Node, which installed npm, or

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,239
Node package manager. We downloaded the

8
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,530
starter files from my GitHub repository

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,350
and used npm to install the packages for

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,940
our Angular application, as defined in the

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,210
package.json file. We then saw how to open

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,804
this sample application in VS Code and use

13
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:39,140
npm scripts to run that application.

14
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,750
Lastly, we covered ES modules and how

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,939
TypeScript uses ES module syntax to export

16
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:47,399
and import functionality from our ES

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,810
modules. We introduced Angular modules and

18
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,380
how they organize our application and

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,840
promote application boundaries. Recall the

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,850
architecture for the sample application

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,619
that we are building that we outlined in

22
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:03,079
the first module? Since I used the Angular

23
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,909
CLI to create the starter files, it

24
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,680
created the index.html file and our root

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,569
AppComponent. In the next module, we'll

26
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:22,000
examine these files and start writing some Angular code.
