As we prepare for our Angular journey,

1
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:06,000
there is something more to install before

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,789
we begin, npm, which stands for Node

3
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:13,630
package manager. What's that, you ask? You

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,660
can think of npm as two things. First,

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,879
it's an online registry or repository of

6
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:22,739
open source and free libraries and

7
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:25,449
packages. It contains many JavaScript

8
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:28,390
packages, such as Angular, TypeScript, and

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,539
Bootstrap, which is a web‑styling

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,039
framework. Second, npm is a command‑line

11
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:36,549
utility for interacting with that

12
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:39,890
repository. We can type commands such as

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,880
npm install some library name. Npm will

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,689
locate the specified library in the

15
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:48,479
repository and install it on your local

16
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,880
machine in a subfolder of the current

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,909
folder named node_modules. In this

18
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:57,049
illustration, I'm in the user's Deborah

19
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:00,310
folder and install a specific package, the

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,359
fictitious abc package in this example.

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,329
After executing the install command, npm

22
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:09,409
locates the abc package in the repository,

23
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:11,730
creates a node_modules subfolder in the

24
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,569
current folder, and installs the specified

25
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:17,719
library and its dependencies in that

26
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:21,900
subfolder. So npm is a repository and a

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,450
command‑line utility you can use to access

28
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,129
that repository. Npm has become the

29
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,019
package manager for JavaScript

30
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:33,069
applications. With npm, we can install

31
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:35,579
libraries, packages, and applications,

32
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,319
along with their dependencies. We'll need

33
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,510
npm to install all the libraries for

34
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,319
Angular. The npm command‑line utility can

35
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,980
also execute scripts to perform tasks such

36
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,280
as running our application, as we'll see

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,810
shortly. Before we can use npm to install

38
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,609
other things or execute our scripts, we

39
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:00,010
need to install npm. But we can't install

40
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,379
npm directly. We install it by installing

41
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:07,340
Node using this link. Let's take a look.

42
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,150
Following this link takes us to the

43
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,879
download page for Node, which installs

44
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,930
npm. Angular minimally requires this

45
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,289
version of npm. Then select the installer

46
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,979
appropriate for your OS. Feel free to

47
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:23,599
pause the course here and install Node now

48
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,900
if you don't already have it. Installing

49
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,669
Node installs npm. Before we move on,

50
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:32,710
let's check our npm version. Open a

51
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,159
command window and type npm ‑v, for

52
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,599
version. Be sure you have at least this

53
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,569
version of npm. We now have a code editor

54
00:02:42,569 --> 00:01:27,000
and the required version of npm installed. Do we need anything else?
