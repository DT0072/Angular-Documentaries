First things first. Before we can start

1
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:07,250
coding with Angular, there are some

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,919
preparatory steps. Welcome back to

3
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:11,419
Angular: Getting Started, from

4
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:14,140
Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata,

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,820
and in this module, we set up what we need

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,410
to work with Angular. A little preparation

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,579
goes a long way toward a successful

8
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:25,480
adventure. Before we take that first step

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,469
on our journey with Angular, we need to

10
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:30,780
gather our tools and get everything ready.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,810
In this module, we introduced TypeScript.

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,390
We install the tools will need. Then we

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,750
set up our Angular application, and we

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:56,000
talk about modules and what they mean in Angular. Let's get started.
