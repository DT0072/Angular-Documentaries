The first step in our journey is to

1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,230
install what we need, starting with a code

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,789
editor. There are many editors that

3
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:11,220
support TypeScript either out of the box

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,839
or with a plugin. We'll select one of the

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,655
most common editors used by Angular

6
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:19,940
developers, Visual Studio Code, often just

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,929
called VS Code. You are welcome to use

8
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:25,399
your editor of choice, but keep in mind

9
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,199
that your experience with TypeScript will

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,809
be much more pleasurable if you select an

11
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:33,039
editor that understands TypeScript. If

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,060
your project requires use of Visual

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,270
Studio, consider learning Angular using VS

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,000
Code first. Then migrate your skills to

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,719
Visual Studio. You'll be glad you did. So

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,670
what is VS Code? It's a code editor

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,834
created by Microsoft. It runs in Linux,

18
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:54,250
Windows, and OS X on a Mac. It has great

19
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,640
features that support TypeScript coding,

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,975
such as autoâ€‘completion, IntelliSense,

21
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:03,039
syntax checking, and refactorings. It also

22
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,409
integrates well with source control, such

23
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:09,159
as Microsoft's TFS and GitHub. And it's

24
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:12,540
free. If you don't have VS Code installed,

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,829
you can download and install it from this

26
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:17,549
URL. Select the install appropriate for

27
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,319
your OS. Consider pausing the course and

28
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,510
installing VS Code now if you don't

29
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,609
already have it. VS Code is easy to use,

30
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:27,810
and I'll demonstrate its features as we

31
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,590
progress through this course. If you want

32
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,819
to learn more about VS Code, check out

33
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,599
their website or this Pluralsight course.

34
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:06,000
Now that we have a code editor installed, there is one more thing we need.
