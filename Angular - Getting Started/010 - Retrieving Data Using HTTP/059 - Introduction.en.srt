The data for our application is on a

1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,240
server somewhere in the cloud, at the

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,000
office, under our desk. How do we get that

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,880
data into our view? Welcome back to

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,689
Angular: Getting Started, from

5
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:16,510
Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata,

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,010
and in this module we'll learn how to use

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,640
HTTP with observables to retrieve data.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,300
Most Angular applications obtain data

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,289
using HTTP. The application issues an HTTP

10
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,810
GET request to a web service. That web

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,310
service retrieves the data, often using a

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,549
database, and returns it to the

13
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:43,090
application in an HTTP response. The

14
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,460
application then processes that data. In

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,140
this module, we begin with an introduction

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,829
to Observables and the Reactive

17
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:55,030
Extensions. We then examine how to send an

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,780
HTTP request and map the result to an

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,090
array. We add some exception handling and

20
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,310
we look at how to subscribe to observables

21
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,739
to get the data for our view. We finished

22
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:09,069
the first cut of a product data service in

23
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,170
the last module, but it still has hard

24
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,069
coded data. Now, we'll replace that hard

25
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:22,000
coded data with HTTP calls. Let's get started.
