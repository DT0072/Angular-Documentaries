Now that we know the basics of routing,

1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:05,639
we're ready for more. Welcome back to

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,669
Angular: Getting Started from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:11,269
My name is Deborah Kurata, and in this

4
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:13,580
module, we look at several additional

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,570
routing techniques. With what we learned

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,899
in the prior module, a user can now

7
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,070
navigate to any defined route in our

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,530
application. But that only covered the

9
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,539
very basic routing scenarios. What if we

10
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:28,960
need to pass parameters to a route or

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,969
activate a route with code instead of with

12
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:33,630
a clickable element? Or what if we need to

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,450
protect a route and only allow access to

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,780
it in special cases or by certain users or

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,189
ask a user to save changes before leaving

16
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:45,689
a route? In this second module on routing,

17
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:48,070
we examine how to pass parameters to a

18
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,560
route, how to activate a route with code,

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,939
and how to protect our routes with guards.

20
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:55,799
When we're finished with this module,

21
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,509
we'll know how to handle additional

22
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:00,109
routing scenarios, including routing to a

23
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:02,890
component that requires parameters, such

24
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,000
as our product detail component. Let's get started.
