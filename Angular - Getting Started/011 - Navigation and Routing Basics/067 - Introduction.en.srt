A single view does not an application

1
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,429
make. Welcome back to Angular: Getting

2
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:10,089
Started from Pluralsight. My name is

3
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:12,599
Deborah Kurata, and in these next two

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,150
modules, we define routes to navigate

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,589
between multiple views in our application.

6
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:21,129
Users like to have all of the information

7
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,679
they need at their fingertips, so our

8
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,179
applications often provide multiple sets

9
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:29,070
of data in multiple layouts across

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,219
multiple views. Routing provides a way for

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,380
the user to navigate between those many

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,740
views of the application. Whether there

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,710
are five, ten, or hundreds. In this

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,659
module, we start with an overview of how

15
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:46,609
routing works in Angular. We examine how

16
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:49,009
to configure routes and tie routes to

17
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:52,039
actions, and we define where to place the

18
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,700
routed components view. Currently, our APP

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,030
component embeds our product list

20
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,990
component as a nested component. We

21
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,890
instead want to define a set of routes so

22
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,409
the user can navigate to the welcome view,

23
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:09,819
product list view, or product detail view.

24
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,819
We've already built the

25
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:13,390
ProductListComponent, and I've provided

26
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,150
the WelcomeComponent with the starter

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,510
files in the GitHub repository for this

28
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,099
course. As part of the demos in this

29
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:22,260
module, we'll build the shell for the

30
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,840
product detail component. When we're

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,569
finished with this module, we'll have a

32
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:32,000
simple application that routes to multiple views.
