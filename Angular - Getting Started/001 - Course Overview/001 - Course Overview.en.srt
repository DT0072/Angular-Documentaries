Hello, my name is Deborah Kurata, and I'd

1
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:10,949
like to welcome you to my course, Angular:

2
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:13,929
Getting Started, from Pluralsight. This

3
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:15,660
beginner‑level course takes you on a

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,660
journey through the basic features of

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,019
Angular. It guides you down the right

6
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,620
path, making your own journey with Angular

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,440
more pleasant and productive. Along the

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,280
way, we build a sample application so you

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,839
can code along or use it as a reference

10
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,600
for your own development. You'll see how

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,770
Angular provides a consistent set of

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,240
patterns for building components,

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,659
templates, modules, and services, helping

14
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:44,600
you come up to speed quickly. This course

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,969
covers how to build components, how to

16
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:48,640
create the user interface for your

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,289
application in a template, and power it up

18
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:53,969
with data binding and directives. You'll

19
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,609
discover how to build services for logic

20
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:59,270
needed across components and inject those

21
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,579
services where they are needed. You'll

22
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:04,140
learn how to send requests to a web server

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,079
using HTTP and observables. And you'll see

24
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,549
how to set up routing to navigate between

25
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:13,000
the views of your application. In

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,890
addition, you'll see how to use the

27
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,760
Angular command‑line interface, or CLI, to

28
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,969
generate, execute, test, and deploy your

29
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:24,709
Angular application. By the end of this

30
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,540
course, you will know the basics you need

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,909
to get started building your own Angular

32
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:31,730
applications. I hope you'll join me on

33
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:40,000
this journey through Angular: Getting Started, from Pluralsight.
