Testing our Angular code is always

1
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:06,519
important, but often neglected due to the

2
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,789
additional time and effort required to set

3
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:12,169
up and execute the tests. The CLI makes it

4
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:14,480
a bit easier by generating the testing

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,800
spec and configuration files for us. We

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,579
can run these tests using ng test and ng

7
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:26,379
e2e. To run our unit tests, in the

8
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:30,280
terminal window type ng test. This builds

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,219
the application, launches the browser, and

10
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:36,469
executes the Karma test runner. From here,

11
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:39,359
we can see the results of our unit tests.

12
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,310
Angular generated four tests for us, and

13
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,640
they've all passed, so we are all green.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,799
The test runner runs in watch mode so we

15
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,549
can modify our files and the tests will

16
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:55,210
immediately rerun. I'll close the browser,

17
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,920
and notice that it tried to bring it up

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,500
again. I first need to terminate the test

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,280
runner with Ctrl+C, then I'll clear the

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,859
screen with cls. We can use the e2e

21
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:08,900
command to run our endâ€‘toâ€‘end tests using

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,860
Protractor. Let's try that out. Ng e2e.

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,609
Notice that it pops up the browser,

24
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:19,230
executes our application, and closes the

25
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,959
browser again. We can see here that it

26
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,400
successfully executed one spec. Testing is

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,500
a big topic that is beyond the scope of

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,200
this course. See the Pluralsight library

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,569
for more information about testing. Now

30
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:41,000
that we have our application built and tested, we are ready to deploy.
