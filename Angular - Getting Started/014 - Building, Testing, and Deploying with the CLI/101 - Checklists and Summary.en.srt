Here are the key CLI commands for

1
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:09,550
reference. Use ng help or ng, a command

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,939
name ‑‑help to view the CLI documentation.

3
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:15,810
The remaining commands here help you

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,379
create, execute, build, test, and deploy

5
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,250
your Angular application. You may find

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,760
yourself using ng generate a lot. Refer to

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,699
this checklist as you generate the code

8
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:32,020
files for your application. In this

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,579
module, we discovered the purpose and

10
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:37,600
basic features of the CLI. We built an

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,359
application from scratch and examined it's

12
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:43,560
many configuration and startup files. We

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,609
dug into how it serves up our application,

14
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:48,537
learned about its code generation

15
00:00:48,537 --> 00:00:51,189
features, looked at running tests, and

16
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,439
prepared the resulting application for

17
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,829
deployment. Now that we've peeked behind

18
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:59,509
the curtain, you know the secrets of the

19
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:03,539
CLI. There is no wizardry here. There are

20
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,069
more commands and many more flags than

21
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:09,019
what we discussed in this module. To learn

Papa's course happily entitled, Angular

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,590
CLI in the Pluralsight library, it covers

25
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:25,000
many more of its amazing features. Only one module left.
