Our new little application is cool and

1
00:00:04,389 --> 00:00:07,330
all, but it doesn't do much. We need to

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,220
add components, and templates, and

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,279
services, and modules. We do that with a

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,080
generate command. We've already seen this

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,690
command in action, but it can do so much

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:25,550
more. If we type ng g ‑‑help, this lists

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,589
all of the different types of files we can

8
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:30,320
generate with this command. We can create

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,009
simple classes. We can create components

10
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:35,670
with external template and style sheet

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,409
files as we did with the product detail

12
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:40,060
component earlier in this course. We can

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,929
generate our own custom directives, enum

14
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:45,460
values, and route guards as we did with

15
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,149
our product detail guard. We can create

16
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,490
interfaces and modules. We can create

17
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,630
pipes and services all with only typing a

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,090
few characters. Neat! Let's generate a

19
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,120
component. Type ng g c and our component

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,010
name, and let's say welcome. The output

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,010
indicates that it created a style sheet

22
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,590
file, template HTML file, unit testing

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,859
file, and TypeScript file for our

24
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:18,459
component. By default, it created a

25
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:24,000
welcome folder and added these files to it.
