We've mentioned the Angular CLI a few

1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,799
times in this course but haven't really

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,929
discussed what it is or what it can do.

3
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,759
What seemed like wizardry is instead a

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:15,619
fullâ€‘featured tool for building, testing,

5
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:18,539
and deploying our Angular applications.

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,829
Welcome back to Angular: Getting Started,

7
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:23,179
from Pluralsight. My name is Deborah

8
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:26,309
Kurata, and in this module we look closer

9
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:30,100
at the Angular CLI. Let's peek behind the

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,600
curtain and learn more about this amazing

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,159
tool. In this module, we start with an

12
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,299
overview and discover the purpose and

13
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:41,590
basic features of the Angular CLI. We then

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,509
build an application from scratch using

15
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:47,880
the CLI and examine the many configuration

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,810
and startup files it creates. We dig into

17
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,159
how it serves up our application, learn

18
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,039
more about its cogeneration features, take

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,890
a brief look at running tests, and prepare

20
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:05,000
the resulting application for deployment. Let's get started.
