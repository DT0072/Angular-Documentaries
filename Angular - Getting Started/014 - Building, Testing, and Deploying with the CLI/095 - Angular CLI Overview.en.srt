The Angular CLI is a command line

1
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,839
interface for Angular. Its primary purpose

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,740
is to assist Angular developers with

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,000
building an Angular application,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,320
generating Angular files, and executing,

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,239
testing, and deploying Angular

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,589
applications. Before you can use the CLI,

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,949
you need to install it. Just open a

8
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:27,760
terminal window or command prompt and type

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,700
npm install â€‘g @angular/cli. This installs

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,170
the CLI globally so you can use it from

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,950
any folder. If you have not yet installed

12
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,750
the CLI, do it now. Once you have it

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,479
installed, we'll jump into a demo and try

14
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:50,140
it out. I've already installed the CLI.

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,909
Now, how can we find out what the CLI can

16
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:56,399
do? One option is to use the ng help

17
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,310
feature. We can see that it is listing

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,170
every command. Let's try out the version

19
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,329
command. Type ng for the angular CLI and

20
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:10,209
the command. We'll use the v alias. And we

21
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:12,769
see a nice text output, including our

22
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:16,030
angular CLI version. When you watch this

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,189
course, you may have a newer version. Use

24
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:21,109
the help command any time you need

25
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:23,920
assistance with the CLI commands or their

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:33,000
flags. Now let's build a new application from scratch using the CLI.
