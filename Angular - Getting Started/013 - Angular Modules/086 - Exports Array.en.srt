The exports array of the NG module

1
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:07,759
decorator allows us to share an Angular

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,500
module's components, directives, and pipes

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,820
with other modules. We can export any of

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,949
this module's components, directives, and

5
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:17,109
pipes so they can be pulled in when

6
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:20,190
another module imports this module. We can

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,530
also re‑export system Angular modules such

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,429
as forms module and HTTP module. We can

9
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:29,730
re‑export third‑party modules such as

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,859
material design. Material design is a set

11
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:35,320
of high‑quality user interface components,

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,170
including buttons and dialogues, and we

13
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,369
can re‑export our own modules. Here are

14
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:43,509
some things to keep in mind when using the

15
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:47,170
exports array. Export any component,

16
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,679
directive, or pipe if another component

17
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,829
needs it. A module can export any of its

18
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,980
declared components directives or pipes.

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,039
Re‑export modules to re‑export their

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,799
components, directives, and pipes. This is

21
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,840
useful when consolidating features for

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,640
multiple modules to build a convenience or

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,680
shared module. We can re‑export something

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,900
without importing it first. An Angular

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,909
module only needs to import the

26
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,140
components, directives, and pipes that are

27
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,209
required by the components declared in the

28
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:23,310
module, but the Angular module can still

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,829
provide capabilities to other modules that

30
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:29,280
import it by re‑exporting. In this

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,480
example, a shared module exports the forms

32
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,680
module, even though it did not import it.

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,950
So any module that imports the shared

34
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,969
module will have access to the NG model

35
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:43,950
and other forms directives. We'll see this

36
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,810
in an upcoming demo. Never export a

37
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,840
service. Services added to the provider's

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,549
array of an Angular module are registered

39
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,459
with the root application injector, making

40
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:58,829
them available for injection into any

41
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,599
class in the application, so there is no

42
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:09,000
point in exporting them. They are already shared throughout the application.
