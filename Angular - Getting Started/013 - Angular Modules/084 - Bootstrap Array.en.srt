As we have seen, every Angular application

1
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,380
has at least one Angular module called the

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,890
root application module or AppModule. And

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,099
an Angular application has at least one

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,120
component called the root application

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,859
component or AppComponent. The AppModule

6
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:22,679
bootstraps the AppComponent to provide the

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,579
directive used in the index.html file. We

8
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:28,739
covered the bootstrapping process in the

9
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:30,980
Introduction to Components module earlier

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,789
in this course. The bootstrap array of the

11
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:36,859
NgModule decorator defines the component

12
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,390
that is the starting point of the

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,219
application. This is the component that is

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,939
loaded when the application is launched.

15
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:45,859
Here are some things to keep in mind when

16
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:48,469
using the bootstrap array. Every

17
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:50,890
application must bootstrap at least one

18
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,539
component, the root application component.

19
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,659
We do this by simply adding the root

20
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:59,009
application component to the bootstrap

21
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:02,750
array of the root application module. The

22
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,590
bootstrap array should only be used in the

23
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,290
root application module, AppModule. As we

24
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:15,000
build other Angular modules, we won't use the bootstrap array.
