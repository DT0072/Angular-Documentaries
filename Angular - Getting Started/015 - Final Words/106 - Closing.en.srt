Congratulations, you've made it, yay!

1
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:07,849
You've completed the journey through the

2
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:11,550
basics of Angular. But the road goes ever

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,089
on and on. There are so many more paths

4
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:17,414
for us to take and so much more to learn.
