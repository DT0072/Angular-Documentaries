This course covered the basics, but there

1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,419
is so much more. On Pluralsight, the

2
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:10,480
Angular: First Look course provides a

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,529
comparison of AngularJS to the newer

4
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:16,300
versions of Angular and presents a more

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,969
fullâ€‘featured sample application. The

6
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:21,850
Angular CLI course covers much more about

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,420
the Angular CLI. Angular Reactive Forms

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,960
covers building and validating data entry

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,289
forms with Angular and details basic CRUD,

10
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,659
or create, read, update, and delete,

11
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,200
operations using HTTP. In the Angular

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,520
Routing course, you'll learn how to define

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,539
more complex routes, pass data to routes,

14
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:44,939
guard your routes, preload data for your

15
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:47,200
views, lazy load routes for better

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,500
performance, and much more. Angular

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,030
Component Communication provides effective

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,950
solutions for tracking and sharing state

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,609
and sending notifications between

20
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:01,049
components. This course teaches you

21
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:03,979
numerous communication techniques and,

22
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:07,340
more importantly, which to use when.

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,189
Angular Fundamentals expands on the basics

24
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:12,620
and covers more intermediate information

25
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,170
on every key aspect of Angular. And Unit

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,040
Testing in Angular teaches you everything

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,629
you need to know to unit test your Angular

28
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:24,790
projects, including testing services,

29
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,439
component templates, and dealing with

30
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,969
asynchronous code. In addition to courses,

31
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:33,219
the Angular documentation is very

32
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:36,370
comprehensive and is a great reference to

33
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,799
everything Angular. And I've set up a

34
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,260
GitHub repository for this course so you

35
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,780
can use it as a starting point or learning

36
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,670
aid. It provides starter files if you want

37
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,090
to try building an application yourself,

38
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:55,000
or you can review the completed course files here.
