At the beginning of this course, we

1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,389
defined Angular as a JavaScript framework

2
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:09,519
for building client‑side applications

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,970
using HTML, CSS, and a language such as

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,669
JavaScript. But this is a somewhat narrow

5
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:18,839
view of Angular, focusing on using it just

6
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:21,550
for client‑side web applications. But

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,379
Angular is actually so much more. A better

8
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,339
definition is that Angular is a platform.

9
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,020
It supports multiple languages, multiple

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,689
templating syntaxes, and multiple

11
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:37,579
rendering targets. It has features to

12
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,179
support mobile web, such as material

13
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:42,710
design, a set of widgets that work across

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,219
devices, Angular Universal to prerender

15
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:49,109
views on the server, and web workers for

16
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:52,479
background processing. And Angular

17
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,679
supports native mobile development using

18
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,590
products such as Ionic and NativeScript.

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,729
Keep an eye on Pluralsight and Angular.io

20
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:06,000
for more information on these exciting technologies.
