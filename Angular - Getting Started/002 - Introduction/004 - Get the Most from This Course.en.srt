First are the prerequisites. This is a

1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,910
beginner‑level course, but this course

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,830
assumes you have some basic knowledge of

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,669
JavaScript for code, HTML for building the

4
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:13,980
user interface, and Cascading Style

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,120
Sheets, or CSS, for styling. You don't

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,820
have to have much experience, but a

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,420
working knowledge of each will help you

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,010
get the most from this course. Though not

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,920
required, it is helpful if you have had

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,739
some exposure to object‑oriented

11
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:29,160
programming concepts, maybe through coding

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,820
with C++, C#, Java, or PHP. But if you

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,159
don't have any exposure to OOP, that's

14
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,189
okay. You do not need any prior knowledge

15
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:40,820
of Angular or TypeScript. We'll cover what

16
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,880
you need in this course. Another way to

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,780
get the most from this course is to join

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,000
the discussion. Thoughts, comments, or

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,219
questions as you watch this course? Feel

20
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,619
free to use the Discussion tab. You can

21
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,200
find the link to the discussion on the

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,700
Pluralsight page for this course. Or

23
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,259
follow me on Twitter. It would be great to

24
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,740
hear about your experiences with Angular.

25
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,329
There is also a blog post specifically for

26
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:08,739
this course at the URL shown here. This

27
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:10,909
post lists common issues along with their

28
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:13,500
solutions. If you are having problems with

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,459
the code for the course, check here first.

30
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:19,189
There may already be a solution posted.

31
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:21,530
Keep this URL handy as you work through

32
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,719
the course. When building web

33
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,290
applications, regardless of the

34
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,939
technologies we use, there are often lots

35
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:29,909
of steps and places where things can go

36
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,319
wrong. That's where a good checklist can

37
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,769
come in. I'll present checklists at the

38
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:36,980
end of each module, and we'll use them as

39
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,950
a brief review of what was covered in that

40
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,340
module. Feel free to jump ahead to the

41
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,260
checklist if you have any problems when

42
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,599
coding along with the demos in the module.

43
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,670
And consider referencing these checklists

44
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,569
as you start building your own Angular

45
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:53,090
applications. Coding along on this journey

46
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,950
is another great way to get the most from

47
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,280
this course. Though not required, it is

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,189
often helpful to try out the presented

49
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,129
code as you navigate through the course.

50
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:03,609
To get you started, I've set up a public

51
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:06,299
GitHub repository specifically for this

52
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,920
course. It is called

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,849
Angular‑GettingStarted, and you can find

54
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:12,819
it at this URL. The starter files for the

55
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,289
sample application are here. You can use

56
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:17,050
these files as a starting point if you

57
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,430
want to code along with the demos. If

58
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,080
you'd prefer to follow along with the

59
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,370
completed code, you can find that here. If

60
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,050
you're new to GitHub, simply click this

61
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,240
button to download all of this code as a

62
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:35,000
ZIP file. So what is this sample application? Let's take a look.
