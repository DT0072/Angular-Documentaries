00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,180
In the last module, we set up the

1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,620
infrastructure for our Angular

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,669
application. Now we are ready to build our

3
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:10,660
first component. Welcome back to Angular:

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,310
Getting Started, from Pluralsight. My name

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,120
is Deborah Kurata, and in this module, we

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,699
walk through building a very basic

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,449
component with a focus on clearly defining

8
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:23,300
the component's parts, their meaning, and

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,390
their purpose. We can think of our Angular

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,089
application as a set of components. We

11
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:31,480
create each component, then arrange them

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,579
to form our application. If all goes well,

13
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:36,920
those components work together in harmony

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,700
to provide the user with a great

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,509
experience. In this module, we take a

16
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,719
closer look at what an Angular component

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,039
is and examine the code we need to build

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,259
one. We walk through how to create the

19
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:51,859
component's class and how and why we need

20
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:54,420
to define metadata. We look at how to

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,490
import what we need from external modules,

22
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,959
and we discover how to bootstrap the app

23
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,250
component to bring our application to

24
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,379
life. We'll continue to add to this

25
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,299
application throughout this course.

26
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:10,280
Lastly, we discuss the Angular compiler

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,709
and where to find syntax and compiler

28
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:15,180
error messages in case something goes

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,459
wrong along the way. Looking again at our

30
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:20,680
application architecture that we defined

31
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,049
in the first module, I had used the

32
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,810
Angular CLI to create the initial content

33
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,370
for my starter files, including the

34
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,950
index.html file and the app component,

35
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,090
which I then updated for our sample

36
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:26,000
application. In this module, we'll rebuild this app component. Let's get started.
